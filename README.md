# Pedal_GUI
## Setup
Copy both GUIslice and XPT2046_Touchscreen-master folders to your Arduino libraries folder (usually found in Documents\Arduino\libraries, if unsure, open the Arduino IDE and go to File > Preferences and look at Sketchbook location for the correct path). Once both folders are in the Arduino library, open the file GUI.ino from the GUI folder and compile as normal.
